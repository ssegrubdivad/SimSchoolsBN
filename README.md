# SimSchools BN

SimSchools BN is a comprehensive tool for creating, analyzing, and querying Bayesian Networks with a specific focus on simulating schools and education systems. While the core application can work with various types of Bayesian Networks, it is tailored for educational simulations.

## Features

- Input parsing for .bns and .cpt files
- Support for discrete and continuous variables relevant to educational contexts
- Multiple inference algorithms (Variable Elimination, MCMC, Junction Tree)
- Query interface for probabilistic reasoning in educational scenarios
- Visualization of network structure and query results
- Extensibility framework for custom node types and distributions specific to educational modeling
- Learning module for structure and parameter learning from educational data
- Sensitivity analysis capabilities for educational factors

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Source code for the application
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests
- `docs/`: Documentation files
